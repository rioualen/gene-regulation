    This config file is designed to work with the workflow Paeruginosa.py.

    The workflow is intended to find parS binding site for the parB protein
    in Pseudomonas aeruginosa species.

    Note\: yaml format prohibits using tabulations.

    Optional parameters, if not provided, are automatically set to the default value provided with the given program.
