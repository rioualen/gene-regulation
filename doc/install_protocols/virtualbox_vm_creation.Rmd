# Creating an NGS VM under Virtualbox


## To do

1. Create a separate virtual disk for the data, and explain how to mount it on the virtual machine.

## Requirements

1. Virtualbox software can be downloaded from
    [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

2. The VM is built under Ubuntu 14.04 (latest long-term supported version)

    [http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/ubuntu-14.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/ubuntu-14.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso)

------------------------------------------


## Creation of the virtual machine

1. Open VirtualBox

2. Click on the **New** button. 

3. Parameters

- Name and operating system

    - Name: reg-genomics-vm-2015-07
    - Type: Linux
    - Version: Ubuntu (64 bits)
    
- Memory size:	2048 Mb (this can be modified afterwards). 

- Hard drive:	*Create a virtual hard drive now*. 

- Hard drive file type: *VMDK* (Virtual Machine Disk). 

    I chose this option because it ensures a wider compatibility with other OS and Virtual Machine management systems. 

	   Another potential advantage of VMDK is that it enables to split virtualdisks in files <=2Gb, which is convenient to store them on FAT partitions. 

- Storage on physical hard drive
    - Select *Dynamically allocated*
    - Activate the option *Split into files less than 2Gb*, which allows to store the VM on FAT partitions for Windows host machines.


- File location and size
    - name of virtual hard drive file:    reg-genomics-hdd
    - max size of virtual hard drive:	    18GB
    - click on **Create** button

        Beware: the size has to be larger than you real needs, because Ubuntu will automatically create some big  partitions (/dev and /run/shm). Since we allow dynamical memory allocation, it is fine to set the max size to 18Gb, which will be grossly assigned as follows:

        - max 14Gb for the root partition /
        - 2Gb for /dev
	      - 2Gb for /run/user




At this stage, the VM has been created and needs to be configured before installing the operating system. 

---------------------------------------


## General configuration of the network for your VirtualBox program

Before configuring the virtual machine, we need to tell VirtualBox how it will enable your local virtual machines to interact with their host (the operating system of the machine on which the VM is running).

1. Open **VirtualBox Preferences**

2. Open the tab *Network* > *Host-only Networks*
     - click on the "+" icon
     - this creates a network vboxnet0. Select this network, click on the screw driver icon (*edit host-only network*), and set the following options:

      - *Adapter* tab
          - IPv4 Address: 192.168.56.1
          - IPv4 Network Mask: 255.255.255.0
          - IPv6 Adress: blank
          - IPv6 Network Mask Length: 0

      - *DHCP Server* tab
          - Check *Enable Server*
          - *Server Address:* 192.168.56.100
          - *Server Mask:* 255.255.255.0
          - *Lower Address Bound:* 192.168.56.101
          - *Upper Address Bound:* 192.168.56.254

## Configuration of the virtual machine

In the VirtualBox main window, select the newly created virtual machine, and click on the **Settings** button. We will successively select the different tabs and configure them. 

### Network

VirtualBox offers many alternative ways to configure network communications between the virtual machine, the host machine, and the external network. 

To get more information about network settings: 

* VirtualBox manual page: [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html)).
* An excellent tutorial: [http://christophermaier.name/blog/2010/09/01/host-only-networking-with-virtualbox](http://christophermaier.name/blog/2010/09/01/host-only-networking-with-virtualbox)

We present here one possible way to configure your Virtual machine, but this should be adapted to the particular security/flexibility requirements of the network where the maching has to run. 


In the VM settings, select tne *Network* tab. VirtualBox enables you to specify several adapters, each corresponding to one separate network access (e.g. using an ethernet card + wi-fi connection).

- click on the tab *Adapter 1*,
- check *Enable Network Adapter*
- Attached to: *Host-only Adapter*
- Name: *vboxnet0* (this network must have been created beforehand)


#### Additional networks (optional)


**BEWARE!** If you activate his adaptor your VM will be visible from external computers in the same network as the host  machine.

See information at: [https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_bridged](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_bridged)

- click on the tab *Adapter 2*,
    - check *Enable Network Adapter*
    - Attached to : *Bridged Adapter*
    - Name: choose an option corresponding to the actual internet connection of the host machine (e.g. ethernet cable, Wi-Fi, ...).

Note: you can also activate a third adapter, for example to support both an ethernet card (Adapter 2) and a Wi-Fi connection (Adapter 3). This is particularly interesting for laptop computers. 


### Storage

Click on the **Empty** disc icon in the storage tree.  Select the disc icon on the right and fetch the downloaded \*.iso image  (see **Requirements**)
Click on *OK*

You can now start the VM. 

## Operating system installation

* Welcome 
    - check the language settings and click on *Install Ubuntu*.

* Preparing to install Ubuntu
	  - leave all default parameters and click *Continue*.

* Installation type
	  - (leave the default) Erase disk and install Ubuntu, click *Install Now*.

* Where are you (automatic)
      - Paris

* Keyboard layout
      - French - French

* Who are you ?
      - Your name			        Regulatory Genomics
      - Your computer's name	reg-genomics
      - Pick a username 		  rg
      - Choose a password     reg-genomics
      - (Activate the option Log in automatically)
      
Restart once installation is completed. 

Once on the desktop, go to the VM menu: select *Devices* then *Install Guest Additions CD image*.
Run it. 

The VirtualBox Guest Additions will provide closer integration between host and guest and improve the interactive performance of guest systems.
Reboot again to see the new display.

## Ubuntu tips

### Shell coloring

```
nano ~/.bashrc
```
Fetch following paragraph and uncomment command `force-color`.
```
# uncomment for a colored prompt, if the terminal has the capability; turned
# off by default to not distract the user: the focus in a terminal window
# should be on the output of commands, not on the prompt
force_color_prompt=yes
```
```
source ~/.bashrc
```


## Connection to VM through the host machine. 

**In the VM terminal: **
```
sudo apt-get install --quiet --assume-yes ssh ## install ssh
ifconfig ## get the IP
```
**In the host's terminal:**
```
ssh rg@192.168.56.101 ## access the VM by ssh using its IP address
```
**Note:** If you're running or have been running several virtual machines, you might encounter problems with the host's known keys
when trying to connect to your VM via `ssh`, such as: 
```
WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!
Add correct host key in $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending ECDSA key in $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts:16
  remove with: ssh-keygen -f "$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts" -R 192.168.56.101
ECDSA host key for 192.168.56.101 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
```
In such case, just proceed with the recommended command, which will remove previous connection parameters for the IP address:
```
ssh-keygen -f "$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts" -R 192.168.56.101
```
Once you're connected to the VM via `ssh`, proceed with:
```
rsync -ruptvl {me}@{myIP}:.ssh .
ssh-agent > ~/agent
source ~/agent
ssh-add
```

# VirtualBox hacks and tricks

## Clipboard sharing between guest and host

For the desktop version of Ubuntu, it is convenient to enable copy-paste between the guest and the host.

- Select the VM
- In the VirtualBox menu, select *Machine* -> *Settings*
- In panel *General*, select the tab *Advanced*
- Set *Shared clipboard* to *Bidirectional*

## Useful commands to manage VirtualBox

### List running VMs

  `VBoxManage list runningvms`

### Get the IDs of the virtual machines

`VBoxManage list runningvms | awk -F"[{}]" '{print $2}'`

### For convenience, we store the IP of the machine of interest in an environment variable VMID

`VMID=\`VBoxManage list runningvms | awk -F"[{}]" '{print $2}'\``

### Get properties of the VM

`VBoxManage guestproperty enumerate ${VMID}`

### List information about a given virtual machine

`VBoxManage showvminfo ${VMID}`

 Note: that command fives the MAC address, but no IP address

`VBoxManage showvminfo ${VMID} | grep '^NIC'`

### Resize your virtual disk

* vdi 

```
cd ~/Virtual Box\ VMs/reg-genomics
VBoxManage modifyhd YOUR_HARD_DISK.vdi --resize SIZE_IN_MB
```

* vmdk

Note: tried and failed, got iot from [this link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11659005/how-to-resize-a-virtualbox-vmdk-file)

```
VBoxManage clonehd "reg-genomics-150730-hdd.vmdk" "cloned.vdi" --format vdi
VBoxManage modifyhd "cloned.vdi" --resize 100000
VBoxManage clonehd "cloned.vdi" "resized-reg-genomics-150730-hdd.vmdk" --format vmdk
```
