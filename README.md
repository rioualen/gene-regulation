# France Genomique  Workpackage 2.6 - Gene Regulation  
*Claire Rioualen - Sept. 19th, 2016*

This git repository holds shared code for the analysis of Next
Generation Sequencing data related to gene regulation: ChIP-seq,
RNA-seq, and related technologies. 

The goals are multiple.

1. Avoid duplication of efforts by sharing the developments of
different bioinformaticians involved in ChIP-seq and RNA-seq projects.

2. Ensure portability and re-usability of the code.

3. Enable validation of the code by independent users.



We have chosen to use the [Snakemake workflow management system](https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/Home)[1] 
in order to build reproducible and flexible NGS analysis pipelines.

# Snakemake workflows

Snakemake is a tool that enables the creation of analysis pipelines, based on the python language and the make concepts of rules and targets. 

A rule contains the commands to generate a given target. 
A workflow can be defined as a series of files generated by successive rules. 

Here, we present a repository of reusable NGS-specific rules, as well as a few workflow examples for standard ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses. 

**A tutorial on Snakemake** basic usage is available in the doc section: [`doc/snakemake_tutorial`](doc/snakemake_tutorial).

# Workflow example

In the [example directory](https://github.com/rioualen/gene-regulation/blob/master/examples) you will find several case studies. Each study includes the following files:

  * `config.yml`, a configuration file that contains the necessary paths and parameters
  * `samples.tab` contains a list of sample IDs, and possibly any additional info on samples
  * `design.tab` contains the samples to be compared (typically, pairs of ChIP/input in a ChIP-seq study)
  * `README.md`, a file describing how to execute the corresponding workflow

Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file in order to execute the whole workflow. 

The workflow can generate a flowchart of the analysis, here is the chart for ChIP-seq_SE_GSE20870 study case:

# Virtualization

**Full tutorials** can be found in the `doc` section, including the creation of a virtual machine/docker container, the installation of all the tools and dependencies and the execution of the workflows: [`doc/gene-regulation_tutorials`](doc/gene-regulation_tutorials).

These tutorials have been developed for ChIP-seq studies; however RNA-seq pipelines are soon to be included. 

# Pre-requisites

We recommand using one of our [tutorials on virtualization](doc/gene-regulation_tutorials), in order to run the workflows under a unix system without damaging your installation. 

However, this repository contains a makefile that installs all the tools and dependencies used by gene-regulation. 
*[NB currently only ChIP-seq dependencies are included, RNA-seq specific tools are to be included soon.]*

```
make -f gene-regulation/scripts/makefiles/install_tools_and_libs.mk all
source ~/.bashrc
```
